**Key:**

**Goal:**
I want to filter my music further through chaining multiple playlists together using set-wise operations, like intersection, union, etc...
* Idea 1: Create Song Objects that each contain its own list of “tags”, instead of being considered inside an array-type object like a vector
* Idea 2: Because I’m not working with many songs anyway, considering each user probably has at most a couple thousand songs spread across multiple playlists, I don’t need to fully implement the tags, and simply need to perform a set-wise intersection with multiple sets (playlists) to simulate the use of multiple “tags”

<!-- Weekly Updates -->
### Week One
###### *Dates:* June 16 - June 22, 2024

###### *Main Objective:* Refamiliarize yourself with what you have, and get set up on github, make markdown project log 

#### Forgot Which Days:
- ✅ Set Up Github Repo
- ✅ Create Project Log Template + Upload to Github
- ✅ Make Sure Old Code Still Works
- ✅ Workshopped Project Goal as Set Operations Instead of Filtering Through Tags

### Week Two
###### *Dates:* June 23 - June 29, 2024

###### *Main Objective:* Figure out how to make api calls, and functionize them for easier use. Try to make a template for the different calls: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

#### June 24:
- Updated the log because I didn't actually USE it last week I just made one. I'm still getting used to this log
- uiverse.io is nice
