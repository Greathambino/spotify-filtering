**Goal:**
I want to filter my music further through chaining multiple playlists together using set-wise intersection
* Idea 1: Create Song Objects that each contain its own list of “tags”, instead of being considered inside an array-type object like a vector
* Idea 2: Because I’m not working with many songs anyway, considering each user probably has at most a couple thousand songs spread across multiple playlists, I don’t need to fully implement the tags, and simply need to perform a set-wise intersection with multiple sets (playlists) to simulate the use of multiple “tags”
